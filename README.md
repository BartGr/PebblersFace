PebblersFace
============

Pebble's Watchface w/ missed calls/unread SMS indicator.

Based on Less Simple watchface by tpett (https://github.com/tpett/pebble-less-simple), with added unread sms/missed call counters.


!!!!! For indicators to work You need Pebbler application (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bg.pebbler) installed on Your phone (sorry, Android only), as well as original Pebble application.

Feel free to modify it any way You want - Pebble deserves some nicer indicators than my simple text one :) 
You can import it directly to awesome Katharine's  CloudPebble IDE (https://cloudpebble.net/ide/) via github: https://github.com/BartGr/PebblersFace.git and play with it.
